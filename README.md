# covibot
A Reddit bot which gives COVID-19 stats of a specific region to Redditors based on their post title.

A SpaceJam 2021 project. Out of ~120 teams, placed Top 5 Freshers' Track and Top 15 overall.

To get it up and running, add the PRAW library to Python (3.6+), using pip install praw.

Navigate to the Python folder, enter Lib folder, site-packages, and then open praw.ini

Here, add a bot, like shown below:

Make sure you've registered a Reddit script application before this step, 'cause that's where you'll get the client ID and client secret.
[bot1]
client_id=
client_secret=
password=
username=
user_agent=

Here, user agent can be any name.

Once you've got this in place, you're ready to go!

Note: covibot is designed to run in r/SpaceJam2021, a subreddit I created for testing covibot. By changing the line subreddit = r.subreddit("SpaceJam2021"), the bot can be deployed pretty much anywhere.

To learn, in detail, the process I used to create covibot, read my three part guide on Medium.

UPDATE: covibot-24-7.py is essentially the same bot, but now can run continuously.
